## 🎯 Project Goals Documented
- Eliminate clerical errors in eyeglass order creation
- Use structured data from Excel workbook instead of free-form entry
- Generate lab-ready text files compatible with existing systems
- **No patient-identifiable data handling** (remains in existing system)

## 📊 Data Source Analysis
- Excel workbook: `Optical_Normalized_Catalog_FULL_v2.xlsx`
- 10+ tabs with complex relationships
- Comprehensive validation rules and constraints
- Frame catalog, materials, treatments, designs, tints, etc.

## 🏗️ Architecture Planning
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express OR Python/FastAPI
- **Database**: SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod)
- **Excel Processing**: Robust parsing and caching strategy

## 📋 Development Phases Defined
1. ✅ **Phase 1**: Repository setup & documentation
2. 🔄 **Phase 2**: Data ingestion planning
3. 🔄 **Phase 3**: Architecture design
4. ⏸️ **Phase 4**: Implementation (awaiting approval)
5. ⏸️ **Phase 5**: Testing & documentation

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Create GitHub Repository**: 
   - Repository name: `optical-order-app`
   - Make it public or private as preferred
   - Push local repository to GitHub

2. **Set up GitHub Projects** (Optional):
   - Create project board for task management
   - Set up milestones for each development phase
   - Create initial issues for Phase 2 tasks

### Phase 2 Tasks (Data Ingestion Planning)
- [ ] Analyze Excel workbook structure in detail
- [ ] Define data models and schemas
- [ ] Plan validation rules and error handling
- [ ] Design data access patterns

### Phase 3 Tasks (Architecture Design)
- [ ] Finalize technology stack decisions
- [ ] Design API endpoints and data flow
- [ ] Create UI/UX wireframes
- [ ] Define testing strategy

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### No Coding Yet
- All implementation is on hold until explicit approval
- Current focus is on planning and documentation
- Architecture decisions are recommendations, not final

### Data Security
- System will NOT handle patient-identifiable data
- All patient information remains in existing system
- Focus is on order creation and validation only

### Excel Workbook
- Need access to `Optical_Normalized_Catalog_FULL_v2.xlsx`
- Will be used as single source of truth
- Complex relationships between tabs require careful analysis

## 📞 Getting Started with GitHub

To create the GitHub repository:

1. Go to GitHub.com and sign in
2. Click "New repository"
3. Repository name: `optical-order-app`
4. Description: "Web application for opticians to create eyeglass orders using structured data"
5. Choose public or private
6. **Do NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"
8. Follow the instructions to push existing repository

## 🎉 Ready for Next Phase

The repository is now fully set up with comprehensive documentation and planning. The project is ready to move into Phase 2 (Data Ingestion Planning) once the GitHub repository is created and you're ready to proceed.

**Remember**: No coding will begin until you explicitly approve it. The current focus remains on planning and documentation.
